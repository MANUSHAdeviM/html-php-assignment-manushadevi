âœ… Difference Between count() and sizeof() in PHP

In PHP, both count() and sizeof() are used to count the number of elements in an array. But here's the difference and behavior:

ðŸ”¹ 1. count()

Primary function to count elements in an array or countable object.

Returns the number of elements in the array.

Also supports COUNT_RECURSIVE for multidimensional arrays.

<?php
$arr = [1, 2, 3];
echo count($arr);  // Output: 3

ðŸ”¹ 2. sizeof()

Alias of count().

Provides the same result as count().

Added for compatibility with other languages like C.

<?php
$arr = [1, 2, 3];
echo sizeof($arr);  // Output: 3
