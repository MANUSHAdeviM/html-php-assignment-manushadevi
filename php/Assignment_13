$sub = substr(12345, 2, 2);
echo “sub is $sub”;

 1. substr(12345, 2, 2)
substr() is a function that works on strings, not numbers.
The number 12345 will be implicitly converted to a string: "12345".
Then substr("12345", 2, 2) means:
Start at index 2 (0-based indexing → third character)
Take 2 characters
"12345"
 Index: 0 → 1, 1 → 2, 2 → 3, 3 → 4, 4 → 5
Result: "34"
